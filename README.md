This SuperCollider instrument will pop two windows on script launch. The larger of these two is an XY scope. The smaller of these two is a set of 5 toggle-style buttons. The 5 buttons do the following (from left to right):

1) clean mic input on/off
2) pitch shifter on/off
3) delay input on/off
4) delay output on/off
5) scope color changer on/off
